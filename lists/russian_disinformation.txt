Noted by The Guardian and The Telegraph of potentially using Generative AI in some of its stories.

! EADaily (Eurasia Daily) is a Russian-language news website that focuses on politics, economics, and international relations, particularly in the post-Soviet space. The website was founded in 2015 and positions itself as a provider of analytical journalism with a strong focus on Eurasian geopolitical issues. EADaily exhibits a strong pro-Russian, nationalist, and right-leaning bias, particularly in its coverage of international affairs. Its reporting often portrays Russia as a stabilizing force in global politics while casting Western nations, especially the United States, NATO, and the European Union, as aggressive or destabilizing actors. Coverage of conflicts involving Russia, such as the war in Ukraine, tends to present Ukrainian forces negatively while amplifying Russian military successes.
