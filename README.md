A collection of **automated** AdGuard Home blocklists. 

This repository was created to help clear the web of harmful content, with a specific focus on **removing russian garbage** and general internet garbage (adware, phishing, spyware).

While these lists are tailored for Ukrainian users 🇺🇦, the security and privacy protections are beneficial for everyone.

## 📋 Available Blocklists

Select the list that suits your needs. Copy the **Link** and add it to your AdGuard Home.

| List Name | Description | Link (Copy this) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🛡️ Combined: ALL** | **Recommended.** Includes everything: Garbage, Malware. | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SerhiiMandrykin/blocklists/main/combined/all.txt` |
| **🚫 Block Russian Garbage** | Combines lists to block all russian garbage and disinformation. | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SerhiiMandrykin/blocklists/main/combined/fuckallrussian.txt` |

> **Note:** These lists are automatically updated and deduplicated every time changes are pushed to this repository.

## 📂 Project Structure

This project uses "Infrastructure as Code" to manage blocklists.
* **`lists/`**: Source files. This is where I manually add domains (e.g., `adware.txt`, `garbage.txt`).
* **`configs/`**: JSON configuration files that tell the compiler how to merge the lists.
* **`combined/`**: **Do not edit manually.** These files are auto-generated by GitHub Actions.
