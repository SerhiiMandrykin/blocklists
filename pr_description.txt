- `ukr.net` — Ukrainian email provider (legitimate, used as sender for phishing emails)

## Notes

UAC-0099 has updated their toolset, replacing LONEPAGE with MATCHBOIL as their primary loader. The attack chain involves phishing emails (from compromised UKR.NET accounts) with court summons theme, linking to file hosting services to download double archives containing HTA files. The HTA executes obfuscated VBScript that deploys MATCHBOIL, which can then load MATCHWOK (backdoor for PowerShell command execution) and DRAGSTARE (stealer targeting browser credentials, documents, and system information). The `authorization.rutech.tech` subdomain is covered by blocking the parent domain `rutech.tech`.
